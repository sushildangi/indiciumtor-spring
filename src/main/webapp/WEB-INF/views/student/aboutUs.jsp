                        What separates us from others..?
                    <ol>
                        <li>As most of the Educational websites offers students pools of resources, but fails to
                            provide a common platform where users can put their queries and get the answers from
                            other users, but we at <b>"Indicium Tor"</b> provides you with this functionality through
                            Discussion Section.
                        </li>

                        <li>It isint easy for students to directly communicate with their Head of Department on some
                            issue,so they can post their queries to their Head , and they are kept anonymous from head.
                        </li>
